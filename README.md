# PRaCTES session 7: high performance computing

"High performance computing" usually means writing and running parallel programs on large numbers of processors. I'm interpreting the scope of this session a little more broadly, though. The first half will focus on understanding the performance of serial programs, with an emphasis on why some programming languages produce code that is dramatically (i.e., several orders of magnitude) faster tha others. The second half will focus on understanding how parallel programs decrease program execution times and provide some practing running and interpreting benchmarks to measure the speedup produced by parallelization.

## Part 1: programming languages, compilers, and serial performance

## Part 2: parallel computing
